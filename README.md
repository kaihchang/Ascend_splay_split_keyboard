# Kai Ascend, a wireless split keyboard with encoders & displays

First time designing my own keyboard. Also my first Kicad project.

I wanted a board with both MX and Choc switches, creating a natural elevation when used without wrist rests. One of the reasons I start using split ergos is to save desk space, so I'd like my board to be wireless (utilizing ZMK) and not rely on extra supports.
Thought about getting rid of "Q" and "P" positions since I prefer using extra pinky column (same as pinky column in schema but anyway) for those, but then that doesn't really save any space and pin, so I kept them eventually.

Some suggested to use wires instead of infills to make soldering easier but keep the infills for the environment cuz' manufacturers are gonna use them anyways, so I added those in v1.3 and had some minor changes.
Haven't edited the STL files for the case of v1.3.
